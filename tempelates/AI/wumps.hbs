        <h1>Wumps World</h1>
            <p>The Wumpus World’s agent is an example of a knowledge-based agent that represents Knowledge representation, reasoning and planning. Knowledge-Based agent links general knowledge with current percepts to infer hidden characters of current state before selecting actions. Its necessity is vital in partially observable environments</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Problem Statement:</li>
                <P>The Wumpus world is a cave with 16 rooms (4×4). Each room is connected to others through walkways (no rooms are connected diagonally). The knowledge-based agent starts from Room[1, 1]. The cave has – some pits, a treasure and a beast named Wumpus. The Wumpus can not move but eats the one who enters its room. If the agent enters the pit, it gets stuck there. The goal of the agent is to take the treasure and come out of the cave. The agent is rewarded, when the goal conditions are met. The agent is penalized, when it falls into a pit or being eaten by the Wumpus.
                    Some elements support the agent to explore the cave, like -The wumpus’s adjacent rooms are stenchy. -The agent is given one arrow which it can use to kill the wumpus when facing it (Wumpus screams when it is killed). – The adjacent rooms of the room with pits are filled with breeze. -The treasure room is always glittery.</P>
            </ul>

                <h1>The Wumpus World Properties</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Partially observable:</strong> The Wumpus world is partially observable because the agent can only perceive the close environment such as an adjacent room.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deterministic:</strong> It is deterministic, as the result and outcome of the world are already known.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sequential:</strong> The order is important, so it is sequential.</li>
                    <li><strong>Static:</strong> It is static as Wumpus and Pits are not moving.</li>
                    <li><strong>Discrete:</strong> The environment is discrete.</li>
                    <li><strong>One agent:</strong> The environment is a single agent as we have one agent only and Wumpus is not considered as an agent.</li>

                <li>Agent dies = -1000 points</li>
                <li>Each move of the agent = -1 point</li>
                <li>Agent uses the arrow = -10 points</li>

                <li>A cave with 16(4×4) rooms</li>

        <h2>Exploring the Wumpus World</h2>
        <li>We will now explore the Wumpus world in AI and use logical reasoning to determine how the agent will reach its objective.    </li>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Agent's first step:</strong> Initially, the agent is in the first room or on the square [1,1], and we already know that this room is safe for the agent, so we will add the symbol OK to the below diagram (a) to indicate that room is safe. Then, the agent is represented by symbol A, the breeze by symbol B, the glitter or gold by symbol G, the visited chamber by symbol V, the pits by symbol P, and the wumpus by symbol W. The agent does not detect any breeze or Stench in Room [1,1], implying that the neighboring squares are also fine.</li>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="/images/wumps2.jpg" alt="Centerd Image"  />
    </div>
    <li><strong>Agent's second step:</strong> Now that the agent has to proceed forward, it will either go to [1, 2] or [2, 1]. Assume the agent moves to room [2, 1]. The agent detects a breeze in this chamber, indicating that the pit is nearby. The pit can be in [3, 1] or [2, 2], so we'll put the symbol P? to indicate whether or not this is a Pit room.
Now, the agent will pause and reflect before making any bad moves. Finally, the agent will return to the [1, 1] chamber. The agent visits rooms [1,1] and [2,1], so we will use V to symbolize the visited squares.</li>
    <li><strong>Agent's third step:</strong> At the third stage, the agent will proceed to room [1,2], which is fine. The agent detects a stench in the area [1,2], indicating the presence of a Wumpus nearby. But, according to the game's regulations, wumpus cannot be in the room [1,1] nor in [2,2]. (Agent had not detected any stench when he was at [2,1]). As a result, the agent deduces that the wumpus is in room [1,3], and in the present state, there is no breeze, implying that there is no Pit and no Wumpus in [2,2]. So it's safe, and we'll label it OK, and the agent will move in further [2,2].</li>
    <li><strong>Agent's fourth move:</strong>Because there is no stench or breeze in room [2,2], let us assume the agent chooses to relocate to [2,3]. The agent detects glitter in the room [2,3], so it should take the gold and climb out of the cave.</li>
</ul>
